# My Online CV 

This is an online, interactive CV that I built to act as an easily accessible reference point for people to get to know what I do. The site itself acts as a portfolio to showcase some of my development capability, and takes a lot more creative liberties than a traditional pdf CV in order to be engaging and stand out.
